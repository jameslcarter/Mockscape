## How to contribute to Mockaco

It's great you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project to move on!

Please take care of reading existent code to follow the same conventions and use clean code intentions when writing new code. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them :-).

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/natenho/mockaco/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/natenho/mockaco/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **mock template** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Please [open a new issue](https://github.com/natenho/mockaco/issues/new) describing the feature so it can be discussed before you start writing it.

#### **Do you have any other questions?**

* Simply [open a new issue](https://github.com/natenho/mockaco/issues/new).

Thanks!
